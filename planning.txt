Q: Do the exercies classes (addition, subtraction etc.) encapsulate a single question?
A: Yes.  We will call a generator (or similar) to generate a series of objects.

Q: Will the individual classes (addition, subtraction etc.) contain formatting?
A: No.  We want the questions to deal with the numeric values only.  We will have formatting classes to take care of the layout.  This will allow for more flexible designs down the road (ie LaTeX or other).

Q: Do we want to rely on utility classes (ie generate random tuples based on input)
A: Yes.  We wish to have utility classes because this will allow us to consolidate functionality used by many classes.  We will not place such functionality in the base Exercise class as it is not needed for all inhereted classes.

To Do:
	- Look into properties for validation, or assertion (assert statement)

Possible To Do:
	- refactor objects to accept keyword args
